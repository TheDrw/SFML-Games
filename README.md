# SFML-Games
Games built using SFML 2.5.1 in Visual Studio 2017

This is a repository of cloned games that I made with SFML strictly using only the [API documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/) on the SFML site as my guide. I'm not allowed to google, look up tutorials or use anything outside of the API documentation. This is mainly just for practice for myself.
 
Games I plan on doing (but not limited to) in order: Pong, Asteroids, Pac-Man, Tetris, Bust-a-Move, some platformer(TBD).

In pong, I named the project circles when I was testing things, but it is really the pong game. I'm too lazy to try to figure out how to rename it. Not currently finished.
