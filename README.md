# SFML-Games
 games built using SFML 2.5.1 in Visual Studio 2017

 This is a repository for games I am making with SFML using strictly only the (API documentation)[https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/] on the SFML site as my guide. I'm not allowed to google, look up tutorials or use anything outside of the SFML site. This is mainly just for practice for myself.
 
 
 First game is pong. I named the project circles when I was testing things, but it is really the pong game. I'm too lazy to try to figure out how to rename it. Not currently finished.
